    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p class="sectionText">
      This portfolio project captures a snapshot of the end-to-end re-design of a live business website‚ÄîPenny Juice. The initial website was outdated, non-responsive, and difficult to navigate. I redesigned its layout and branding using a user-centric approach, utilizing accessible and responsive design principles at each stage of the process. The result is a vibrant, usable, and accessible new web experience.

    <h1>Original Site & Critique</h1>
    <p class="sectionText">
      The initial website lacked a modern layout structure, color contrast, semantic HTML, and responsiveness. The problems were brought to attention through WAVE and manual inspection.

    <h1>Reflection</h1>
    <p class="sectionText">
      This projecThis project pushed me to think far beyond aesthetics. On the surface, redesigning a site like Penny Juice might have seemed like a purely visual exercise‚Äîtweaking colors, moving layouts around, making it "modern." But the deeper I got into the process, the more I realized that the most important design decisions are made below the surface. Good design is not always about how something looks; it's about how it works, who it serves, and whether it empowers or disenfranchises.
      <br><br>One of the most significant things I learned was about the importance of accessibility and inclusivity in design. Tools like the WAVE Accessibility Checker and WebAIM forced me to confront gaps I hadn't even considered‚Äîcontrast issues that could render text illegible to someone, missing labels that would leave screen reader users in the dark, and semantic HTML that's essential for keyboard navigation. These issues weren't visible in the mockups, but they were at the center of the experience. I realized accessibility wasn't an add-on or extra, but a fundamental component of competent and ethical design.
      <br><br>On a personal level, this project gave me greater faith in both my design intuition and technical skills. From the implementation of a responsive grid system to launching a refined prototype, I was continuously switching between logical and creative thinking. It reminded me how interdisciplinary web design actually is‚Äîa balance of empathy, structure, and aesthetics.
      t pushed me to think beyond aesthetics. It taught me to question the inclusivity and usability of every visual decision. I came away with stronger technical skills and a clearer understanding of how thoughtful design impacts experience.
